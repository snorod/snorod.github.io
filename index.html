			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>ARE YOU TRULY PASSIONATE ABOUT IGN?</strong>
					<p>Absolutely.  I didn't talk too much about that in my video, because I figured many applicants go on and on about it.  I read almost every IGN article and I watch Beyond(!), Up At Noon, and Anime Club.  I'm a fan of Max, Brian, everyone else on Beyond, Destin Legarie, and above all Adam Sligar and Francisco Velazquez since they're part of Code-Foo and might be reading this.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>ARE YOU REALLY AS BLAND IN PERSON AS YOU ARE IN YOUR VIDEO?</strong>
					<p>Boy, I sure hope not.  Talking to a camera is inherently awkward; I'm not sure how vloggers do it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>WHY SHOULD IGN HIRE YOU IF YOUR WEBSITE IS UNIMPRESSIVE?</strong>
					<p>My website changes all the time because I mainly use it as a playground for trying things out, so it's not always an accurate indication of my skill level.</p>
					<p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>WHY DIDN'T YOU DO MORE OF THE PROGRAMMING CHALLENGES?</strong>
					<p>Believe me, I really wanted to.  I worked on my Code-Foo application whenever I had a spare moment (even during spring break!); I just haven't had enough time to do much outside of what's required.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>WHY IS YOUR GITHUB SO EMPTY?</strong>
					<p>A lot of the work I do is on a private Georgia Tech Github.  I also don't push all of my code to GitHub anyway.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE THING ABOUT IGN?</strong>
					<p>The reason that I've been a daily visitor for so many years, I think, is that IGN is great at knowing what content its audience wants to see.  IGN's evolution past "video game news" is one of the main reasons it's remained relevant.  Now, I can get all the information I care about just from IGN.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>ARE YOU REALLY GOOD AT HANDSTANDS?</strong>
					<p>It's funny that you ask!  I AM really good at handstands.  I can also dislocate a lot of things in my body.  Isn't that something you'd like to see in person?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE VIDEO GAMES, ANIME, SUPERHEROES, AND MOVIES?</strong>
					<p>Video games: Sly Cooper, Kingdom Hearts, Injustice, Uncharted, Naruto Ultimate Ninja, BioShock, Red Dead Redemption, Smash Bros.  Anime: One Punch, Baccano, Cowboy Bebop (makes me want to cry though), Death Note, Another.  Superheroes: The Flash, Batman, Nightwing, Spider-Man.  Movies: Meet the Robinsons, The Godfather, Inception, American Beauty, Boyhood, and many more.</p>
